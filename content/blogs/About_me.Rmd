# Introduction
Hello I'm Aayush Khurana and Iâ€™m a student at LBS pursuing a Masters in Financial Analysis. Prior to joining LBS, I was at King's College London where I pursued my undergradate degree in Economics and Management. During my time at KCL, I was heavily involved in several societies namely -

1. **Enactus KCL as a Finance director** 
2. **King's Global Markets as a VP** 
3. **the Squash team representing the KCL Men's team in tournaments**. 

Previously, I have worked at *EY* as a business consultant and at *ING bank* as an equity research analyst. To further enhance my understanding of Finance, I also recently worked as a Corporate Finance analyst at a US based Fintech - [*EdgeConneX.*] (https://www.edgeconnex.com/)

## Multi-cultural background

Since an early age, I have been fortunate enough to gain an exposure to people from varied backgrounds and cultures. Having studied at an international school, I also had the chance to visit over 10 countries as part of my high school educatiom (this includes a trip to the Nasa Kennedy space center too!). Therefore, having lived in five cities across three countries, I enjoy interacting with people from different cultures and consider myself to be adaptable to working in diverse environments.

## Aspirations
Given that our I am pursuing a 1 year masters, I am looking forward to making the most of my time at LBS. In particular, I aim to enhance my understanding of financial markets, participate in several clubs including the Finance and Squash clubs and most importantly meet and learn from people with diverse backgrounds. Post LBS, I hope to pursue a career in Capital Markets or Financial consultancy.

## My hobbies

During my free time, I enjoy listenting to podcasts and reading, particularly new developments in the field of behavioural economics and finance (below are a few of my top picks). Apart from this, I always try to reap the benefits of staying in London and exploring different restaurents, cafes and pubs with my friends and family. I also enjoy travelling and exploring different cities and culture. Here's a couple of pictures from my recent trip to Scotland 

* Misbehaving by Richard Thaler

* Animal Spirits by George Akerlof and Robert Shiller

* The Indicator from Planet Money (10 min Daily podcast) by NPR

```

Lastly, I also enjoy playing cricket and Squash. In fact, I represented my local squash club back in India at the national level and also had the chance to play for the KCL Men's Squash team as well. Hence a snap from our team which played at the national championships of UK universities in Warwick.
