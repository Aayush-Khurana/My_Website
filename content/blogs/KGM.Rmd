### During my time at King's College London, I was also part of the executive committee of King's Global Market as the VP of Corporate Relastions and the Middle Eastern Equity Analyst. KGM is a finance and research-based society focused at helping students prepare for a career in finance. I was also involved in the following -

1. **Expanded the membership from an initial 12 members to over 90 students, including 35 researchers publishing monthly articles on equity markets and 15 trading analysts; established as the largest paid membership base of any finance society at KCL**
2. **Led a 7-member team and collaborated with other finance societies to host several speaker events including the Rising Markets Forum, featuring various speakers from JP Morgan, Citibank, HSBC to discuss financial opportunities in emerging markets**

### Apart from this, as the Middle-Eastern Equity analyst, I also 

1. **Published over 10 articles primarily focused on Middle-Eastern equity markets, over the last 15 months, for graduates, academicians and individual investors looking for up-to-date and quality research on financial markets.**
2. **Reviewed government publications, financial listings, upcoming IPOâ€™s and trends of major Middle-Eastern indices including the TADAWUL, BIST 100, DFM general; incorporated the relative equity valuation models to enhance research output**

### Here is an excerpt of one of my published articles -
