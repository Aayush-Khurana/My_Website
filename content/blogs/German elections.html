<h3>Here is one of the various challenges we worked on as part of our core elective. The challenge involved reproducing the election poll tracker (originally created by The Guardian) in RStudio.</h3>
<p>Here is the graph we were asked to re create using dplyr and tidyverse packages in RStudio</p>

<p>The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.</p>
